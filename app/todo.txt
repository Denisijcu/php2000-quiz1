Create a new PhalconPHP project. Have the index action to display a form that submits to an action “profile”,
 asking for the user’s name, date of birth, short biography and CSV of its interests.

Submitted the page via POST. If any of the fields are empty the page should redirect back and display 
above the form the error message: “The field FIELD_NAME is invalid. Please try again”.

If everything is ok, the page “profile” should display the user’s name, right below the user’s age and 
if today is its birthday, a message saying: “Happy Birthday”. Right below the user’s bio and right below
 the list of interests, each shown as a different “tag” with gray background and round corners.

You can use Bootstrap to make your HTML better looking and work faster.
